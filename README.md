# Business-Outfitted-Bob
This is my first project that I have done using phaser.js. The goal of this game is to collect as much money as you can without running into walls or tax papers. More tax papers spawn each time you collect money which increases the difficulty. Bob's movement speed increases as you collect more money

The only controlls you need to know before playing is using the four arrow keys to move your sprite. Run this project under the HTML file to start playing

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- HTML5
- Phaser.js

The start screen should look like this on your local machine
